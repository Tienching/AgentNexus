**Duration:** 589s

**Tasks:** 1 completed, 0 failed


### Completed

- Fix asyncio.timeout Python 3.10 compatibility in channel_service.py

### Gaps Identified
1. **Python version compatibility**: Code uses `asyncio.timeout()` (Python 3.11+) but the runtime is Python 3.10. This silently breaks channel message processing for tool calls.

2. **Redis dependency without graceful degradation**: Audit log and some session storage features hard-depend on Redis. Tests that touch these paths fail in Redis-free environments. The audit log has no in-memory fallback.

3. **Incomplete installer**: `src/runtime/plugins/installer.py:136` has `# TODO: 实际调用 pip/uv 安装` — skill package installation is stubbed.

4. **Pydantic V1 legacy model**: `src/server/models/legacy.py` uses deprecated class-based config. Will break on Pydantic V3.

5. **Test coverage for evolve engine**: The evolution engine (`src/nanobot/evolve/engine.py`) contains template text with TODO placeholders (it's a prompt template, not a code gap — but worth noting the engine is prompt-driven with no dry-run mode).
